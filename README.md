_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge v24.04.17]((https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-05-29), Glam Up My Markup: Beaches_

## What I Built


I developed **Beach Quest with Finley and Friends**, a visually stunning and interactive web app designed to showcase a list of beaches provided in the prompt. Being from a coastal city in India, I knew that static images wouldn't capture the true beauty of beaches, so I opted to use videos for the visuals. This led me to work closely with the **HTML5 Video element and API**.

I envisioned the website as a **virtual tour**. To achieve this, I synchronized background videos with the corresponding beach descriptions. This inspired another idea: adding **tour guides** for each beach. That's where Finley and his friends come inâ€”they guide users through the beaches and share their pro tips, making the website more informative.

I built this website with **a strong focus on accessibility, ensuring it is user-friendly for everyone**. To enhance user experience, **I included a navigation menu for easy jumping between sections, a progress bar with previous and next buttons, a loader to handle dynamic video loading, and responsiveness for all devices.** Although I recommend visiting the website on a desktop to truly appreciate the visuals, it is also fully viewable on mobile devices.

_Note: you'll only be able to see the loader if there is a delay in loading the video, if you have good internet speed, likely, you will not see it._


I have deployed the website on **GitHub Pages** : https://everly-gif.github.io/BeachQuest/

## Journey
Building this wasn't as simple as I initially thought it would be. I faced numerous challenges throughout the process, especially since the rules strictly prohibited altering the markup directly. As a result, every interactionâ€”from the tour guides and navigation bar to the buttons, loader, video element, video overlay and progress bar had to be added using pure JavaScript. Here below I write an overview of my journey.

### Setup

My first challenge was to find freely available videos of the beaches listed in the prompt. After extensive internet searching, I discovered [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/beach/). I am incredibly grateful for this resource, as the freely available videos for most of the beaches allowed me to bring my vision to life. _(Thank you, Pexels, all video credits to the rightful owners!)_

Secondly, I needed a tour guide. I went through a lot of different character sets before I found Finley and friends. I found them on [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/)(credits to rightful owners). With this, I was all set to dive into logic!

### Development
At first, I began by directly injecting the additional HTML elements needed through JavaScript with the necessary classes and attributes. I then also modified the existing markup through javascript with the necessary attributes.

#### Progress Bar
I used an event listener, `onclick`, to handle the previous and next functionality. I added a `data-index` attribute for easy looping between sections. Later, using the `linear-gradient` CSS property, I dynamically updated the bar color in JavaScript.

#### Beaches, Background Videos, Tour Guides, and Speech Bubbles
I maintained data in an array structure for easy looping. The previously injected `data-index` attribute facilitated easy retrieval of the index, allowing me to set the correct background video, tour guide, appropriate speech bubbles, and beach description for each view. I achieved this by toggling between the `display:none and block/flex` properties.

#### Navigation Menu
I extracted all the data from the markup and appended it to another separate div, `menu-items`. Since the navigation menu was a separate view from the existing markup, I gave each item a `data-slide` attribute to indicate which section to jump to when clicked. I achieved this by toggling between the `display: none` and `block/flex` properties.

#### Responsiveness and Other Styling
I wrote a substantial amount of CSS to center-align the text on top of the background videos. I used properties such as `position`, `z-index`, and `display` to achieve this alignment. Focusing on user-friendliness, I wrote media queries to ensure that the website looks great on all devices. The videos I used are dimensioned to support desktop viewing, so for mobile, I used the `object-fit:fill` property to avoid any white spaces.

### Deployment

I was pretty happy with the development locally after working on it for quite a few days. It was time to take it to the next level!

I first faced the file too large issue. That is when I realized my videos were huge. Locally, I never had an issue, so I hadn't considered the file size. I needed to optimize them to be able to push to GitHub. I used [FreeConvert](https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor), an online video compressor tool that helped me to significantly reduce the video file size. I was then able to push my code and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

Later, I faced the grey screen issue while navigating the website using the prev and next buttons. This was happening because the video was taking time to load and set. Again, locally I never faced this issue; it only occurred after deployment. However, this severely affected the user experience of the website, so I had to address it. After much internet surfing, I found video attributes such as `poster` that could contain a loading image/gif URL, which would be displayed before the video loads. But I wasn't really happy with what I was able to achieve with it. So the research continued. 

I came across event listeners `loadstart` and `canplaythrough`, which then simplified my issue. I decided to toggle between the `display: none` and `display: flex` properties based on these event listeners on a custom loader. I used a wave loader gif from [LottieFiles](https://app.lottiefiles.com/animation/d6b7aa5a-4106-407b-b9ec-d5be3079433d), centered it on a div with a custom background color, and used it as my loading screen.

## What I learned and What I am proud of
It was great to challenge myself to think outside the box and pick up a front-end challenge. It's been a good amount of time since I worked with plain JS, HTML, and CSS. So, this challenge was a nice re-brushup on those skills.

I'm particularly proud that I was able to bring this vision to life despite the challenges I faced especially during deployment and finding assets.

Websites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) were also a huge help in resolving my blockers.
